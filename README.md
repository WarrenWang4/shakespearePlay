# Determining the Players for each Shakespeare Play

For this project, I have implemented 2 Classification model and compared their accuracy to determine the players for each shakespeare play. The models we used were Gaussian Naive Bayes and Decision Tree. Check out the Jupyter notebook to see how one model compares to the other in terms of accuracy.

## Data
The dataset I used for this project was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays.
